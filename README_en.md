## üîç What is it?

`drda_generator` (Shorthand for **D**elta**R**une **D**ialogues **A**nimation Generator) is a utility developed in **Godot**. It helps you make dialogue animations looks like in the game DELTARUNE quickly and easily, greatly improves the efficiency of creating DELTARUNE fan animations.

It can be used through:
1.  **Command Line** üñ•Ô∏è (Suitable for advanced users or batch operation)
2.  **Graphical Interface** üñ±Ô∏è (Recommended for most users)

## üñåÔ∏è Graphic Interface Introduction

The graphical interface has two main parts:

1.  **Editor** (Main Workspace):
	*   **Left: Dialogue Manager** - Add, delete, select and sort your dialogues.
	*   **Right: Dialogue Editor** - Write your dialogue using `BBcode` syntax.
	*   **Top: Preview** - Preview the animation!
	*   **Toolbar**:
		*   `fz`: Insert **Chinese font style tag**
		*   `fe`: Insert **English font style tag**
		*   `wsd`: Insert **Dark world dialogue style tag**. Improve your efficiency with the buttons!

2.  **Settings** ‚öôÔ∏è:
	*   Configure the animation generation process.
		*   **FPS**: Frame per second (defaults to 24).
		*   **Background Color**: Background color of the animation.
		*   **Generation Mode**: Merge all dialogues into one video, or generate multiple videos corresponding to each dialogue?
		*   **Output Path**: Location to store the generated files.
		*   **Output Format**: Generated file format (MP4, MOV or GIF).
		*   **Transparent Background**: Control if the background is transparent (MP4 not supported)

## üìñ BBCode Syntax

`BBCode` is a simple markup langauge that uses tags enclosed in brackets `[ ]` (similar to HTML). It allows you to make special effects and control text style in the animation!

1.  **Normal Tags** (Most Common):
	*   **Format**: `[tagname=parameter]Your text[/tagname]` or `[tagname=parameter][/]` (Shorthand)„ÄÇ
	*   **Effect**: Change the style of text enclosed in the tag or add special animations.
	*   **Tag can be nested**! e.g.:
		```bbcode
		[shake level=20][rainbow]Cool Text! [/][/shake]
		```
		*The text will shake and display in rainbow color at the same time.*
	*   **Important Notes**Ôºö
		*   Tags must be properly nested. Things like `[b]Á≤ó‰Ωì[i]Á≤óÊñú‰Ωì[/b]Êñú‰Ωì[/i]` are not allowed.
		*   Abusing `[/]` might make text unreadable. Only using the syntax in simple tags is recommended.

2.  **Self-closing Tags**:
	*   **Format**: `[tagname=parameter]`
	*   **Effect**: Tag that closes itself immediately, without having any text inside.
	*   Example: `[wait=2/]` will make the dialogue pause for 2 seconds and then continue.

### ‚ú® BBCode Tags Supported

Here is a table of BBCode tags supported by `drda_generator`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips for Linux users.

Currently we don't provide Linux artifacts, but the project has been ported to Linux (and perhaps macOS but not tested), and can be built by yourself.

You may need to install FFMpeg using your system package manager in order to export animations to files, or you can put a working FFMpeg binary under `external` directory. In most cases, make sure the directory containing `ffmpeg` can be find in your `PATH`.
